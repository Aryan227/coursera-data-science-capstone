# **Shiny Application**

Next Word Predict is a Shiny app that uses a text
prediction algorithm to predict the next word(s) based on
text entered by a user.

The application will suggest the next word in a sentence
using an n-gram algorithm.


Skills: include natural language processing and text mining.

========================================================
# **Application User Interface**

<small>
The predicted next word will be shown when the app
detects that you have finished typing one or more words.
When entering text, please allow a few seconds for the
output to appear. Use the slider tool to select up to
three next word predictions. The top prediction will be
shown first followed by the second and third likely
next words. Click the image below for a larger view
of the user interface.
