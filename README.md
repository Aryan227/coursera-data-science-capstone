## Course Project

Course repository for the Coursera Data Science Specialization Capstone Project.

The goal for this final project assignment is to implement a learning model for
text prediction. Using the text prediction algorithm, create a product that
provides a user interface that can be accessed by users.

This repository contains the `ui.R` and `server.R` source code files for the
developed Shiny Application as well as the RStudio Presenter files for the
Data Science Capstone Course Project.

### Course Dataset

The training data set to get you started that will be the basis for most of the
capstone can be found below:

* [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip)

You must download the data from the link above and not from external websites to
start.

Later in the course you may use external data sets to augment your model as you
see fit.
